  name: Hue Room Dimmer - Dynamic Up/Down
  description: >
    Dims a Hue Room or Zone (light.<room>) up or down while an input_boolean remains on.
    Uses input_boolean.dimmer_<room> to control the loop and allows user-defined dimming speed.

    âž• Required Helper:
      - input_boolean.dimmer_<room> (e.g. input_boolean.dimmer_office)

    ðŸ›  Inputs:
      - room (e.g. Office â†’ controls light.office and input_boolean.dimmer_office)
      - direction: Up/Down (determines brightness step polarity)
      - brightness_step: Dimming speed as percent step (default = 5%)
