### Added
- Visual setup diagram illustrating integration between Hue, ZHA-based Inovelli Blue switches, and Home Assistant helpers.
- Added troubleshooting info to the README documenting debug log examples and helper usage.
- Scene cycling automation with dynamic scene discovery using `input_number.scene_index_<room>`.
- Paddle dimming functionality via `input_boolean.dimmer_<room>` and `dim_hue_room_lights.yaml` script.
- Support for directional hold (up/down) with brightness adjustment logic.
- YAML templates referencing `room_slug` to standardize helper and scene naming.

### Changed
- Updated debug logs to standardize format and include helper states, active scenes, and light modes (e.g. `xy_color`).
- README enhancements to clarify helper setup and event mapping.

### Fixed
- Color mismatch between identical Hue bulbs by preferring `xy_color` mode in automations.
- Scene restoration logic to better preserve original color temperature vs color mode.

### Deprecated
