# üè† Home Assistant Inovelli Hue Blueprints

This repository contains **dynamic, reusable blueprints** for integrating Inovelli Blue Series dimmers (via ZHA) with Philips Hue lights and scenes. These automations are designed for **state-aware, adaptive lighting control** that evolves with your Hue setup.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **üí° Light On/Off Control**
  - Single tap up: Turns Hue room **on**
  - Single tap down: Turns Hue room **off**
  - Works regardless of whether lights were last controlled by switch, app, or automation
  - Optional: Automatically activates a default scene when turning on

- **Unified Paddle Dimming**
  - Hold paddle: Smooth dim up/down
  - Release paddle: Stop dimming
  - Uses `input_boolean.dimmer_<room>` to control dimming loop

- **üé¨ Scene Cycling (Button 3)**
  - Press: Cycle forward through Hue scenes
  - Hold: Cycle backward
  - Scenes are dynamically discovered per Hue room
  - Tracks state with `input_number.scene_index_<room>`

- **üßº Clean Entity Naming Convention**
  - `light.<room>` for Hue Room/Zone
  - `input_boolean.dimmer_<room>` for dimming control
  - `input_number.scene_index_<room>` for scene tracking

## Overview
![Device Overview](/docs/assets/DeviceFlow.png)

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Create a Hue Room** in the Hue app (e.g. `Office`).
2. **Create Helpers** in Home Assistant:
   - `input_boolean.dimmer_office`
   - `input_number.scene_index_office`
3. **Add Hue Scenes to the room** (e.g. `scene.office_relax`, `scene.office_reading`).
4. **Add Inovelli Blue Switch** in HomeAssistant ZHA 
5. **Import Blueprints** from this repo:
   - `hue_dimmer_zha_unified.yaml` (automation)
   - `dim_hue_room_lights.yaml` (script)
6. **Create the script from the blueprint** in HomeAssistant using the blueprint, create the script (reference your first 
light/swith, this will be dynamically updated by the automation depending on what button is pressed)
7. **Create the automation** in HomeAssistant using the blueprint.  Reference the switch, room/zone, script from step 5., 
and desired brightness step (faster/slower dimming)
8. **Enjoy**

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

For each room (e.g. `Office`), create:

| Entity | Example | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Hue Light Group | `light.office` | Hue Room/Zone |
| Input Boolean | `input_boolean.dimmer_office` | Controls dimming loop |
| Input Number | `input_number.scene_index_office` | Tracks active scene index |
| Hue Scenes | `scene.office_relax`, etc. | Must follow `scene.<room>_<name>` pattern |

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Creating inputs

The inputs are used to allow a single automation to trigger on/off, dimming and scene rotations. 
A set of inputs are required per switch/automation.  Depending on your personal preference, 
these can be configured in the UI or via YAML.  Below provides steps for the HA UI.

### üîò input_boolean: Toggle Helper

This helper is used to enable or disable specific automations or modes.

**Steps to create:**
1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Helpers**.
2. Click **+ Add Helper**, then select **Toggle**.
3. Set a name like `scene_cycling_enabled` or your preferred label.
4. Optionally set the icon (e.g., `mdi:lightbulb-group`).
5. Click **Create**.

### üéöÔ∏è input_number: Slider or Number Box

Use this helper to store values like the current scene index or delay intervals.

**Steps to create:**
1. Navigate to **Settings > Devices & Services > Helpers**.
2. Click **+ Add Helper**, then choose **Number**.
3. Configure the details:
   - **Name**: e.g., `current_scene_index`
   - **Minimum / Maximum**: Set appropriate range (e.g., 0‚Äì10)
   - **Step size**: Set increment (e.g., 1)
   - **Unit of measurement**: Optional (e.g., none or "index")
4. Click **Create**.

### ‚úÖ Tips
- Use the names exactly as defined in your YAML blueprint for seamless automation.
- You can rename or localize labels afterward‚Äîentity IDs remain the key reference.

Once created, these helpers will appear under **Developer Tools > States**, and can be referenced directly in your automations or blueprints.


## üìÅ Included Blueprints

### üîß Hue Paddle Dimming + Scene Cycling (ZHA Event)
- **Path**: `blueprints/automation/inovelli/hue_dimmer_zha_unified.yaml`
- **Handles**:
  - Paddle dimming (start/stop)
  - Scene cycling (forward/back)
  - Light on/off control
  - Default scene activation
  - Detailed logging

### üéöÔ∏è Hue Room Dimmer - Dynamic Up/Down
- **Path**: `blueprints/script/inovelli/dim_hue_room_lights.yaml`
- **Handles**:
  - Smooth dimming loop
  - Customizable brightness step
  - Parameterized by room, direction, and step

---

## üß™ Example Setup: Room = `Office`

1. In the Hue app, create a room named `Office`
2. In Home Assistant, create the following helpers:
   - `input_boolean.dimmer_office`
   - `input_number.scene_index_office`
3. Add or sync Hue scenes like:
   - `scene.office_relax`
   - `scene.office_energize`
4. Create a script from the **Hue Room Dimmer** blueprint:
   - Set `room` to `Office`
   - Set `direction` to `up` or `down`
   - Set `step` to your preferred brightness increment
5. Create an automation from the **Hue Paddle Dimming + Scene Cycling** blueprint:
   - Set `room` to `Office`
   - Link the dimmer script you created
   - Optionally enable default scene activation

Now your Inovelli switch will:
- Tap up: Turn on `light.office` (and optionally activate a default scene)
- Tap down: Turn off `light.office`
- Hold: Dim up/down smoothly
- Release: Stop dimming
- Button 3 press/hold: Cycle through Hue scenes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Scenes not cycling | Ensure scenes follow `scene.<room>_<name>` pattern |
| Dimming not working | Confirm `input_boolean.dimmer_<room>` exists and is toggled |
| Scene not restoring color | Use `scene.apply` instead of `light.turn_on` |
| ZHA events not triggering | Verify correct event IDs in automation trigger |

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting: Debug Logging for Inovelli Hue Blueprints

These blueprints include detailed logging to help diagnose issues with dimming, scene cycling, and helper state tracking. Here's how to interpret and leverage the logs effectively.

---

## üîç What the Logs Show (Example: Office Room)

The blueprints output clear debug messages for key actions and decisions. Below are examples you'll see in the logs when using the `"Office"` room:

- **Scene Cycling Events**  

Cycling to scene.office_relax (index 1 of 4)

- **Helper Validation**  

input_boolean.dimmer_office is off ‚Äî skipping dimming loop

- **Scene Restoration Attempts**  

Restoring previous scene: scene.office_reading

- **Error Handling**  

Scene scene.office_party not found ‚Äî skipping

These logs are designed to provide context-aware feedback, especially when testing dynamic behavior like long-press dimming, scene cycling, or light mode fallbacks.

### üìã Where to Find Logs

- Logs are output to **Home Assistant‚Äôs system log** (`Configuration > Settings > System > Logs`)
- Enable debug logging for automations by adding this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    homeassistant.components.automation: debug
    homeassistant.components.script: debug
